Quick start
==============

In short, the key entities of the framework are presented below.:

* `Replica` is parametrized presentation class of `Telegram Message`.
* `Dialog` between `Telegram-bot` and `Telegram-user` is an yielded iterator of `Replicas`.
* `Discussion` contains a registry of `Dialog`-state for each `Telegram-user`.
* For every `Telegram-user` request `Discussion` iterate by `Dialog` if this request is valid for current `Dialog`.
* If `Replica` contains `Button` the value in `Button` is coded and signed with `Coder`.
* `Discussion` check `Telegram-user` compliance of coming data (by digital signature) when `Telegram-user` click `Button`.
* All `Telegram-user` requests are separated to `Hendlers` of `Buttons` (named `ButtonsHandler`), `Commands` (named `CommandsHandler`) and other input (named `ReplicasHandler`).
