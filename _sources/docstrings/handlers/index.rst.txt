Handlers
========

By focusing on the most commonly requested types of Telegram-bot events, I divided its capture into three routes:

- Buttons-handler;
- Commands-handler;
- Replicas-handler (i.e. "other").

Also all of them can use common `Middleware`.

.. toctree::
   :hidden:

   ./buttons_handler
   ./commands_handler
   ./replicas_handler
   ./middleware
